				<h2>Game Instructions</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome to Test the Tester. This interactive quiz aims to provide a fun experience 
					for anyone studying for the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level certification.
				</p>
				<p>
					You will be given twenty unique questions from a collection of over 100 questions 
					which will test your knowledge of testing. Given that you are bound to get 
					different questions every time, you can play the game as many times as you wish.
				</p>
				<p>
					All the questions are multiple-choice. 
					Some have only one correct answer while others may have two or more correct answers. 
					In these cases, the options will be marked with checkboxes (square box with tick) 
					rather than radio buttons (round box with a dot).
				</p>
				<p>
					You must score 60% or higher on the quiz in order to pass, 
					but you may play as many times as you wish, so why not give it a go?
				</p>
